# Step 2-2: Add UI Guidelines

## Goal
Document the core UI guidelines for the TODO app to ensure a consistent, accessible, and responsive user experience.

## Instructions

### :keyboard: Activity: Add UI Guidelines

In this exercise, you'll guide GitHub Copilot's Agent mode to create a UI guidelines document for the TODO app.

#### :keyboard: Activity: Ask Copilot to create UI guidelines

To ensure the app's UI is consistent and meets project standards, you will:

1. Open the **Copilot** chat panel and switch to **Agent** mode using the dropdown menu.
2. In the Copilot chat input field, ask Copilot to create a new file at `docs/ui-guidelines.md` that describes the core UI guidelines for the TODO app. We want a UI that uses Material components, with a responsive design that work well on both desktop and mobile devices, and it must be accessible. The exact wording is up to youâ€”just make sure your intent is clear!
3. Ask Copilot to update `copilot-instructions.md` to reference the new `ui-guidelines.md` file.

#### Expectations
- Copilot should create the `docs/ui-guidelines.md` file with the provided UI guidelines.
- Copilot should update `copilot-instructions.md` to reference the new UI guidelines doc.

#### Success Criteria
- `docs/ui-guidelines.md` exists and contains the specified guidelines.
- `copilot-instructions.md` is updated to reference `ui-guidelines.md`.

If you encounter any issues, you can:
- Ask Copilot to fix specific problems
- Review that `docs/ui-guidelines.md` was created and `copilot-instructions.md` was updated

## Why?
Documenting UI guidelines up front helps all contributors build a consistent, accessible, and user-friendly interface, and provides a reference for future enhancements and reviews.
