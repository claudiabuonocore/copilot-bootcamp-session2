# Step 2-5: Build with Context

## Goal
Leverage all the context and documentation you have created to guide Copilot in expanding the TODO app.

## Instructions

### :keyboard: Activity: Build with Context

In this exercise, you'll use the `copilot-instructions.md` fileâ€”updated throughout the previous steps to instruct Copilot to enhance the TODO app.

#### :keyboard: Activity: Ask Copilot to build using context

1. Open the **Copilot** chat panel and switch to **Agent** mode using the dropdown menu.
2. In the Copilot chat input field, ask Copilot to use the information and guidelines in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to expand the TODO app. You can use your own words, as long as you make it clear that Copilot should follow the requirements, UI guidelines, testing practices, and coding principles documented in the project.
3. Review the changes Copilot proposes or implements, and ensure they align with the context and standards you have established.

#### Expectations
- Copilot should use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as the primary source of context for building or expanding the app.
- The resulting code and features should reflect the requirements, UI, testing, and coding guidelines documented in the project.

#### Success Criteria
- Copilot references and follows the context in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` when building or expanding the app.
- The new or updated code aligns with the documented standards and practices.

If you encounter any issues, you can:
- Ask Copilot to clarify or adjust its approach
- Review that the implementation matches the documented context

## Why?
Using a single, well-maintained context file helps ensure that all contributors and Copilot itself build features that are consistent, maintainable, and aligned with the project's goals and standards.
